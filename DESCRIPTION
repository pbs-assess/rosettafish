Description: 'rosettafish' translates fish- and
    fisheries-related words or short phrases between languages (mainly
    French to English or English to French, presently). The package has a
    built-in .csv file of English-French translations of common technical
    fisheries terms that are often incorrectly translated by generic
    automatic translators. Users can add to this or use their own file,
    and are encouraged to add to the ever-expanding list of common terms
    using the instructions in the README.md file.
